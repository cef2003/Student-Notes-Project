This is an android app for a third year Lebanese University student to calculate its grades of each course and get the average.
It's written in Kotlin using room database.
It's constructed of two main fragments, the first one where the student fill the needed information (first name, last name and courses grades) and the 
second one where all its data is displayed with the ability of navigating back to the first fragment to edit some courses or even its first and last name.
